# image_streamer
A very simple flask app for a image slide show displayed in chrome kiosk

A minimalistic web-slideshow with image upload facility. Whipped this up 
to use on a Raspberry pi, plugged into a projector, that boots straight into
chromium in kiosk mode. Fulfilled the need to display current research and
upcoming talks in our building without having to wait an age for IT services
to upload to the official system...
